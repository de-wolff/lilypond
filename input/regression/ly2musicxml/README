For testing lilypond, xsltproc and guile are used.

Guile needs to get the commandliine as an argument
-L GUILE_LOAD_PATH=$HOME/build/out/share/lilypond/current/

In all tests where lilypond is used, Lilypond is called with environment 
settings causing invalid arguments in different scheme functions to generate 
a fault.

There are three categories of tests:
The first category (at this moment containing one test) is to test if a fault 
is generated if we expect a fault.

The second category is testing whether the scheme implementation of 
xml functions (xml-library.scm) is correct. 
In those tests lilypond is not used, only guile is used.

The third category is testing whether lilypond music can generate correct 
musicxml.

All categories of tests result in a 3 files:
- a xml files
- a info files
- a xpath file
